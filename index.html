          <p class="about-text">
            Senior Business Process Analyst with experience modernizing process documentation, aligning workflows to actual system
            behavior, and driving cross-functional improvements across enterprise operations and ITSM governance.
          </p>

          <p class="about-text">
            I translate complex operational realities into clear, executable guidance—M&amp;Ps, SOPs, swim lanes, decision logic,
            and governance checkpoints—so teams act consistently and reduce rework. I partner with SMEs, engineering, operations,
            and leadership to surface gaps (controls, handoffs, fallout paths), improve change readiness, and strengthen
            accountability across end-to-end workflows.
          </p>

          <p class="about-text">
            <b>On a personal note.</b> Think positive, be positive no matter the situation! Time will go on with or without you. Don't sit idle waiting for something to happen. 
            Grab life by horns and give it your best shot and once you relaize you're life is but bleep in this eternal universe, you'll understand that nothing is more important than the present! 
          
          <p class="about-text"> 
            <b>Spirit within:</b> I'm a well seasoned veteran of the workforce and IRR Army reservist but does not qualify for the status of veteran. I've earned
            my degrees and salary from ambition, motivation and drive. I worked in the fields since the age of 5, in Texas and Illinois, so I know what hard labor is
            and I have learned to be modest, humble and respectful but don't take it as a weakness for I will protect my moral values, 
            personal standards and religious believes. Agree to disagree, respect to be respected, don't be quick to judge and share the love God intended. This are my
            moral philosophy, a set of personal guidelines, or call it what you will, take them for what they are but build some in your life time and share them with others.
          </p> 
            <p class="about-text">  
            <b>Hobbies:</b> Believe it or not, I've learned to read people from playing poker. Poker has taught me how to read a person's body language, when they're lying, 
            whey they're honest, when they're sneaky and when they are lost. All of these traits can be used in your strategy for monopolizing the game or reading people 
            at work. I highly recommend poker as a hobby to build skills in reading people.
            I also do leather tooling and Pen turning. Leather tooling is the art of placing designs on leather using specific tools that you carve the design into the leather. I find it
            very therapuetic for the sole and relaxing. Pen turning is the art of using a lathe to cut a chunk of wood into a fancy writing pen. I don't do craftwork for money but as gifts for friends and family.
            You can see pictures of my craft on the fourth page if interested.
